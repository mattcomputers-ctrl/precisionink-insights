/**
 * TicketMaterialsEngine — can each open batch ticket actually be made
 * with the materials on hand? (Matt, 2026-10-29.)
 *
 * Pure function, same spirit as CoverageEngine: tickets claim shared
 * inventory in due-date order (earliest DateRequired first, then ticket
 * number), and a pound of material never counts toward two tickets.
 *
 * An MFPP's bulk line is NEVER a shortage while its MFBA is open: the
 * batch exists precisely to make that bulk, so "short because the bulk
 * isn't made yet" is noise (Matt, 2026-10-29 — only the master batch
 * number gets flagged). A pack's real externals are its containers.
 * A pack that is NST with its batch still open isn't checked AT ALL:
 * packaging only starts when the batch goes into BAT, so NST is its
 * normal waiting state (Matt, 2026-10-29). It re-enters the check once
 * released (or once its batch is gone — orphan packs check everything,
 * bulk included, against on-hand stock).
 * An MFBA whose own raw materials are short poisons its MFPPs (mfba_short).
 *
 * Input:
 *   tickets:   [['ordr','context','batch_ordr','bulk_code','date_required','qty']]
 *   materials: [ordr => [item_code => ['qty' => float, 'unit' => string]]]
 *   inventory: [item_code => float available]
 *
 * Output: [ordr => ['status' => 'ok'|'short',
 *                   'shortages' => [{item_code, need, short, unit}],
 *                   'from_mfba' => float, 'mfba_short' => 0|1]]
